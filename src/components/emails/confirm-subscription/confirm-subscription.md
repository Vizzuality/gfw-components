When a user selects to receive alerts related to their area of interest a subscription is created. As each area of interest, and therefore each subscription, can have a unique email we send an email to the specified inbox for the user to confirm they wish to receive these email updates.

Params available:

```js static
{
  confirmation_url: 'a valid url'
}
```

```jsx
<ConfirmSubscriptionTemplate />
```
