Generic email template containing all the components, layout, and styles used in GFW email templates. All parts are cross browser/platform compatible and render close to the browser for Outlook 2016 onwards. NOTE: border radius is not supported by Outlook 2016 meaning the data bubbles appear as squares.

```jsx
<EmailTemplate />
```
