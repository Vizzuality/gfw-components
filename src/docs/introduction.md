A [React](https://reactjs.org/) component library for the [Global Forest Watch](https://github.com/Vizzuality/gfw) project built with [Emotion](https://emotion.sh/docs/introduction) CSS-in-JS styled components. All features have support for Server Side Rendering (SSR), the latest two versions of evergreen browsers and IE>=11. All designs for these components are based on the [Global Forest Watch UI kit](https://invis.io/82QPKXD964H). The library requires installing some external dependancies for fonts and optional featueres so be sure to read the install instructions in full.
