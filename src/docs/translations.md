The `<Header />` component comes with support for Transifex as well as your choice of translation method. To use the default language selector make sure you add the [Transifex Live](https://docs.transifex.com/live/installing-the-javascript-snippet) snippet. If you are using the static script you must add the Transifex script to translate your site.
